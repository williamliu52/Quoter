Quotes

Single Page Application (SPA) built with React using a Python Flask API to search for and view stock prices using the Markit On Demand API.
 
Currently working on getting stock prices stored in a Postgresql database for quicker lookup. 

## Demo

You can view the app in action at http://quotes-pro.herokuapp.com. <br/>
*Please note that since the MoD API is not SSL secured the site must be viewed in HTTP and not HTTPS for the API calls to work.*
